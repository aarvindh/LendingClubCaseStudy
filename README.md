# Lending Club Case Study

```
About lending club - 

LendingClub is a financial services company headquartered in San Francisco, California.It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. At its height, LendingClub was the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform.The company reported that $15.98 billion in loans had been originated through its platform up to December 31, 2015.

Business model

LendingClub enabled borrowers to create loan listings on its website by supplying details about themselves and the loans that they would like to request. All loans were unsecured personal loans and could be between $1,000 - $40,000. On the basis of the borrower’s credit score, credit history, desired loan amount and the borrower’s debt-to-income ratio, LendingClub determined whether the borrower was creditworthy and assigned to its approved loans a credit grade that determined the payable interest rate and fees. The standard loan period was three years; a five-year period was available at a higher interest rate and additional fees. The loans can be repaid at any time without penalty.

## Objective of data set analysis:  

``` 
Lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss
(called credit loss). The credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender 
when the borrower refusesto pay or runs away with the money owed.  

The main objective is to be able to identify these risky loan applicants, 
then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. 
Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.   

Perform an analysis to understand the driving factors behind loan default,
i.e.the variables which are strong indicators of the loan application to be considered default.
